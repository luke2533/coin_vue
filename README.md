3. User wants to sign up to create a portfolio
4. The user records the wrong information
5. The user wishes to view their individual records
6. User wishes to record a sell order

1.4.1 The user has invested in an asset and is looking to see how it has performed for the day with either a positive or negative percentage value based on the past 24 hours. The price tracker will act as the home page/hub listing the top 50 assets so the user only has to scroll down to find their asset.

1.4.2 The user has created an account and wants to record a transaction they have made, to do so they navigate to the My Portfolio page where they can click add transaction and fill out the form with three types of records: buy, sell and staking. The user can then fill out the appropriate sections and click the submit button where the record will then update their portfolio. 

1.4.3 The user is looking to create an account to share their strategies, which they can do through the sign up link in the nav where they can enter a username and password to protect their account. To access their account after its creation a login page will also be linked beneath the signup page for users with an account.

1.4.4 The user has recorded the wrong information when adding a transaction, the user can correct this mistake either by removing or editing the record. To do this the user goes to the portfolio page where their coins are listed, select the coin and scrolling through the record list and has the option of deleting the record which is represented through a bin icon and will prompt the user to make sure they want to do this which the user can select yes and it will be deleted. To edit the record the user clicks the edit icon where they can change the record's details.

1.4.5 The user wishes to view their records for a coin (Bitcoin), the user can find this on the portfolio page where all of their coins are listed along with the total holdings, value, etc which under the action row the user can click the button showing their coins individual records

1.4.6 The user has sold some of their crypto and wishes to record the sale, to do this the user goes to the portfolio page clicks add transaction and selects the sell tab. The user then can fill out the quantity of tokens sold, the price each token was valued at, date and optionally add a note.
